Chemistry student with a minor in environmental science at California Polytechnic Univerisity, San Luis Obispo. I am interested in expanding chemistry experience through research in the environmental or medical fields. My goal is to use my chemistry degree to improve the community either environmentally or medically as helping people as well as the world at large is what I strive to do.
